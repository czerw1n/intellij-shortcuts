SHORTCUTS talk.

who:
- Tomasz Czerwiński
- Odds, LOTR (Live Odds Trading Robots)
- backend, java
- pair programming
- basketball

why bother:
- to focus on important stuff
- to be able to experiment more while coding
- to undo code easily
- not about finishing work faster, it is about making it better
- knowledge not often shared, usually hidden, pair programming as one of the few occasions to learn

limitations:
